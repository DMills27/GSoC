# Get Involved!

## Prerequisites

We are happy to Mentor you as long as you are curious about open source and are eager to learn all the things computer science.
You should bring this across in your application and mention what sparked your interest.
There might be some more prerequisites depending on the idea you want to do.

You will need some tools to work on ideas, please install them:

- [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/download)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- Some text editor, popular ones are [n/vim](https://neovim.io/) and [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but any should do

Feel free to reach out if you have trouble doing so.


## Tell us about yourself

We are curious who you are and what motivates you.
Try to include some information on what projects you previously worked on.
What other things you are doing, maybe you are a student or do a internship at some company.


## Contact us

Once you found a idea you think is interesting or want to propose your own you can join our [gsoc matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:nixos.org).
Feel free to ask questions if something is unclear, we will also try to help if anything else is unclear.
