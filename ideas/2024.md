### nixpkgs library networking functions

Many things in NixOS use the Internet Protocol and other network related technologies, thus a lot of modules and service have to deal with them.
Currently this is mostly done just passing strings as arguments, but it would be a lot more convenient to have things like `lib.types.ipv6`, `lib.types.ipv4` and other functions to for example convert between cidr notation and the bit representation of netmasks.
Some inspiration for functions can be drawn from similar libraries like the [python ipaddress lib](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.12/Lib/ipaddress.py)
This would not just be useful for NixOS it self but also for its users since a lot of folks use it to power network appliances and build infrastructure on top of it.

Skills required/preferred:
Some prior networking knowledge would be useful but is not required. Prior knowledge of the nix programming language is not required, any new-comer wanting to pick this up should easily be able to complete a nix tutorial like [a tour of Nix](https://nixcloud.io/tour/?id=introduction/nix) in one or two afternoons and be good to go.

Possible mentors:

Rating:
medium

Prior efforts:
there was some prior efforts in [nixpkgs#258250](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/258250) but it is stuck for a few months now and also only adds function for legacy ip, it's also quite bare bones and we might want some more advanced things like a function to check if a ip matches a given subnet.

### nixpkgs pnpm tooling

pnpm is a package manager that claims to be up to 2x faster than npm and more efficient than npm when it comes to disk space usage, because of this benefits more and more projects are using pnpm.
We have tooling for the npm but it's mostly incompatible, this is leading to hacky workarounds and makes packaging pnpm projects a pain.
If you decide to work on this project you will gain a lot of knowledge about the gears that make nixpkgs turn, namely things like setup hooks and fetcher.

Skills required/preferred:
Having experience with javascript/frontend tooling like nodejs would most certainly be a plus.

Rating:
hard

Prior efforts:
There is a tool called [pnpm2nix](https://github.com/nix-community/pnpm2nix/) but it didn't get updates in a few years because of [pnpm#1035](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/1035), this should be a non problem for us if we use a fod fetcher like the nixpkgs npm tooling.
Some packages use [a fetcher]((https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/nixos-unstable/pkgs/applications/misc/pot/default.nix#L43)) without strong reproducibility guarantees.
